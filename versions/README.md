# Versions


Here are all the versions of the stim, regrouped under either:
- all\_sentences: the complete set of sentences, in order
- organized: the general order per subject / run of sentences played

These two folders then are organized per version

version 1.0: the original sentences generated by GPT4-o which were really unperfect. Used for sub-01 and half of sub-02. 3200 total sentences.

version 2.0: the more recent sentences: generated by Llama3.2 and audio by openAI. 

version 2.1: same sentences as version 2.0 but the run organization goes to sub-9. Everything has been shifted.
